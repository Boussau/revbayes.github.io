{% section Overview | overview %}

This tutorial shows a simple phylogenetic analysis of extant and fossil bear species (family Ursidae), using morphological data as well as fossil occurrence data from the fossil record. 

{% section Introduction | introduction %}

{% section Setting up the analysis | analysis %}

In this section, we will create the RevLanguage script which will be used to run our phylogenetic analysis in RevBayes.

{% subsection Data and files %}

>On your own computer or your remote machine, create a directory called `RB_FBD_Tutorial`
>(or any name you like).
>
>Then, navigate to the folder you created and make a new one called `data`.
>
>Download the files listed below into the `data` folder, by clicking on the hyperlinked file names below (these files are also listed in the "Data files and scripts" box at the top of this page).
{:.instruction}

In the `data` folder, add the following files:

-   [`bears_taxa.tsv`](data/bears_taxa.tsv): a tab-separated table listing the 18 bear species in our analysis (both fossil and extant) and their occurrence age ranges (minimum and maximum ages). For extant taxa, the minimum age is 0.0 (*i.e.* the present).

-   [`bears_morphology.nex`](data/bears_morphology.nex): a matrix of 62 discrete, binary (coded `0` or `1`) morphological characters for our 18 species of fossil and extant bears.
    
> In the main directory created above, create a blank file called `FBD_tutorial.Rev` and open it in a text editor.
{:.instruction}

This file will be our main script, and will contain all the instructions required to load the data, assemble the different models used in the analysis, and finally configure and run the MCMC. Note that it is possible to split instructions between different Rev scripts, however in this tutorial we will use only one file to keep things simple.

{% assign mcmc_script = "FBD_tutorial.Rev" %}

{% subsection Importing the data into RevBayes %}

We will begin the Rev script by loading the two data files that were downloaded previously.

{{ mcmc_script | snippet:"block#","1" }}

The function `readTaxonData` reads a tab-delimited file. This command creates a variable called `taxa` which contains a table with all of the fossil and extant bear species names in the first column, their minimum age in the second column and their maximum age in the third column.

Next, we will import the morphological character matrix and assign it to the variable `morpho`.

{{ mcmc_script | snippet:"block#","2" }}

RevBayes uses the function `readDiscreteCharacterData` to load a data matrix to the workspace from a formatted file. This function can be used for both molecular sequences and discrete morphological characters.

{% subsection Helper variables %}

Before we begin writing the Rev scripts for each of the model components, we need to instantiate a couple "helper variables" that will be used by downstream parts of our model specification.

We will create a new constant node called `n_taxa` that is equal to the number of species in our analysis (18).

{{ mcmc_script | snippet:"line","22" }}

Next, we will create a workspace variable called `moves`, which is a vector that will contain all of the MCMC moves used to propose new states for every stochastic node in the model graph. Each time a new stochastic node is created in the model, we can append the move to this vector.

{{ mcmc_script | snippet:"line","23" }}

One important distinction here is that `moves` is part of the RevBayes workspace and not the hierarchical model. Thus, we use the workspace assignment operator `=` instead of the constant node assignment `<-`.

{% subsection The Fossilized Birth-Death process %}

{% subsubsection Speciation and extinction rates | FBD-SpeciationExtinction %}

Two key parameters of the FBD process are the speciation rate (the rate at which lineages are added to the tree, denoted by $\lambda$ in {% ref fig_fbd_gm %}) and the extinction rate (the rate at which lineages are removed from the tree, $\mu$ in {% ref fig_fbd_gm %}).
We will place exponential priors on both of these values, meaning each parameter will be assumed to be drawn independently from a different exponential distribution with rates $\delta_{\lambda} = 10$ and $\delta_{\mu} = 10$ respectively. Note that an exponential
distribution with $\delta = 10$ has an expected value (mean) of $1/10$.

We will create the exponentially distributed stochastic nodes for the `speciation_rate` and `extinction_rate` using the `~` stochastic assignment operator.

{{ mcmc_script | snippet:"block#","4" }}

For every stochastic node we declare, we must also specify proposal algorithms (called *moves*) to sample the value of the parameter in proportion to its posterior probability. If a move is not specified for a stochastic node, then it will not be estimated, but fixed to its initial value.

The extinction rate and speciation rate are both positive, real numbers (*i.e.* non-negative floating point variables). For both of these nodes, we will use a scaling move (`mvScale`), which proposes multiplicative changes to a parameter.
Many moves also require us to set a *tuning value*, called `lambda` for `mvScale`, which determine the size of the proposed change. Here, we will use three scale moves for each parameter with different values of lambda. Using multiple moves for a single parameter will improve the mixing of the Markov chain.

{{ mcmc_script | snippet:"block#","5-6" }}

You will also notice that each move has a specified `weight`. This option indicates at which frequency a given move will be performed in each MCMC cycle. In RevBayes, the MCMC is executed by default with a *schedule* of moves at each step of the chain, instead of just one move per step, as is done in MrBayes {% cite Ronquist2003 %} or BEAST {% cite Drummond2012 Bouckaert2014 %}. 
Here, if we were to run our MCMC with our current vector of 6 moves, then our move schedule would perform 6 moves at each cycle. Within a cycle, an individual move is chosen from the move list in proportion to its weight. Therefore, with all six moves assigned `weight=1`, each has an equal probability of being executed and will be performed on average one time per MCMC cycle. 
For more information on moves and how they are performed in RevBayes, please refer to the {% page_ref mcmc %} and {% page_ref ctmc %} tutorials.

In addition to the speciation ($\lambda$) and extinction ($\mu$) rates, we may also be interested in inferring the diversification rate ($\lambda - \mu$) and the turnover ($\mu/\lambda$). Since these parameters can be expressed as a deterministic transformation of the speciation and extinction rates, we can monitor their values (i.e. track their values and print them to a file) by creating two deterministic nodes using the `:=` deterministic assignment operator.

{{ mcmc_script | snippet:"block#","7" }}


{% subsubsection The extant sampling probability | FBD-Rho %}

All extant bears are represented in this dataset. Therefore, we will fix the probability of sampling an extant lineage ($\rho$ in {% ref fig_fbd_gm %}) to 1. The parameter `rho` will be specified as a constant node using the `<-` constant assignment operator.

{{  mcmc_script | snippet:"block#","8" }}

Because $\rho$ is a constant node, we do not have to assign a move to this parameter.

{% subsubsection The fossil sampling rate | FBD-Psi %}

Since our data set includes serially sampled lineages, we must also account for the rate of sampling through time. This is the fossil sampling (or recovery) rate ($\psi$ in {% ref fig_fbd_gm %}), which we will instantiate as a stochastic node (named `psi`). As with the speciation and extinction rates (see {% ref FBD-SpeciationExtinction %}), we will use an exponential prior on this parameter and use scale moves to sample values from the posterior distribution.

{{  mcmc_script | snippet:"block#","9-10" }}

{% subsubsection The origin time | FBD-Origin %}

The FBD process is conditioned on the origin time ($\phi$ in {% ref fig_fbd_gm %}), so we need to specify the origin of the bears clade. We will set a uniform distribution on the origin age, with the lower bound set at the age of the oldest bear fossil and the higher bound set to **justification for the higher bound ?**. 
For the move, we will use a sliding window move (`mvSlide`), which samples a parameter uniformly within an interval (defined by the half-width `delta`). Sliding window moves can be problematic for small values, as the window may overlap zero. However, our prior on the origin age excludes values $\leq 37.0$, so this is not an issue.

{{  mcmc_script | snippet:"block#","11-12" }}

Note that we specified a higher move `weight` for each of the proposals operating on `origin_time` than we did for the three previous stochastic nodes. This means that our move schedule will propose five times as many updates to `origin_time` as it will to `speciation_rate`, `extinction_rate`, or `psi`. **Missing: justification for the higher weight**

{% subsubsection The FBD distribution | FBD-dnFBD %}

All the parameters of the FBD process have now been specified. The next step is to use these parameters to define the FBD tree prior distribution, which we will call `fbd_dist`.

{{  mcmc_script | snippet:"block#","13" }}

Next, in order to sample from the posterior distribution of trees, we need to specify moves that propose changes to the topology (e.g. `mvFNPR`) and node times (e.g. `mvNodeTimeSlideUniform`). We also include a proposal that will collapse or expand a fossil branch (`mvCollapseExpandFossilBranch`), i.e. change a fossil that is a sampled ancestor (see {% ref fig_example_tree %} and {% ref Intro-FBD %}) to a sampled tip, and vice-versa. In addition, when conditioning on the origin time, we also need to explicitly sample the root age (`mvRootTimeSlideUniform`).

{{  mcmc_script | snippet:"block#","14-15" }}

{% subsubsection Sampling fossil occurrence Ages | FBD-TipSampling %}

Next, we need to account for uncertainty in the age estimates of our fossils using the observed minimum and maximum stratigraphic ages. Remember, we can represent the fossil likelihood using any uniform distribution that is non-zero when the likelihood is equal to one (seeÂ {% ref Intro-TipSampling %}). For example, if $t_i$ is the inferred fossil age and $(a_i,b_i)$ is the observed stratigraphic interval, we know the likelihood is equal to one when $a_i < t_i < b_i$, or equivalently $t_i - b_i < 0 < t_i - a_i$. So we can represent this likelihood using a uniform random variable,  uniformly distributed in $(t_i - b_i, t_i - a_i)$ and clamped at zero.

To do this, we will get all the fossils from the tree and use a `for` loop to iterate over them. For each fossil observation, we will create a uniform random variable representing the likelihood, based on the minimum and maximum ages specified in the file [`bears_taxa.tsv`]. 

{{  mcmc_script | snippet:"block#","16-18" }}

Finally, we will add a move that samples the ages of all the fossils on the tree.

{{  mcmc_script | snippet:"block#","19" }}

{% subsubsection Monitoring parameters of interest | FBD-DetNodes %}

There are additional parameters that may be of particular interest to us that are not directly sampled as part of the graphical model defined here. As with the diversification and turnover nodes specified in {% ref FBD-SpeciationExtinction %}, we can create deterministic nodes to sample the posterior distributions of these parameters. Here we will create a deterministic node called `num_samp_anc` that will compute the number of sampled ancestors in our `fbd_tree`.

{{  mcmc_script | snippet:"block#","20" }}

We are also interested in the age of the most-recent-common ancestor (MRCA) of all living bears. To monitor this age in our MCMC sample, we must use the `clade` function to identify the node corresponding to the MRCA. Once this clade is defined we can instantiate a deterministic node called `age_extant` that will record the age of the MRCA of all living bears, using the `tmrca` function.

{{  mcmc_script | snippet:"block#","21" }}

In the same way we monitored the MRCA of the extant bears, we can also monitor the age of a fossil taxon that we may be interested in recording. We will monitor the marginal distribution of the age of *Kretzoiarctos beatrix*, which is sampled between 11.2â11.8 My.
