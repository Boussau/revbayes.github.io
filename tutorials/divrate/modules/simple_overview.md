{% section Overview: Diversification Rate Estimation | diversification_rate_overview %}


Models of speciation and extinction are fundamental to any phylogenetic
analysis of macroevolutionary processes
(e.g., divergence time estimation,
diversification rate estimation, continuous and discrete trait
evolution, and historical biogeography). First, a prior model describing
the distribution of speciation events over time is critical to
estimating phylogenies with branch lengths proportional to time. Second,
stochastic branching models allow for inference of speciation and
extinction rates. These inferences allow us to investigate key questions
in evolutionary biology.

Diversification-rate parameters may be included as nuisance parameters
of other phylogenetic models—*i.e.*, where
these diversification-rate parameters are not of direct interest. For
example, many methods for estimating species divergence times—such as
`BEAST` {% cite Drummond2012 %},
`MrBayes` {% cite Ronquist2012 %}, and
`RevBayes` {% cite Hoehna2016b %}—implement 'relaxed-clock models'
that include a constant-rate birth-death branching process as a prior
model on the distribution of tree topologies and node ages. Although the
parameters of these 'tree priors' are not typically of direct interest,
they are nevertheless estimated as part of the joint posterior
probability distribution of the relaxed-clock model, and so can be
estimated simply by querying the corresponding marginal posterior
probability densities. In fact, this may provide more robust estimates
of the diversification-rate parameters, as they accommodate uncertainty
in the other phylogenetic-model parameters (including the tree topology,
divergence-time estimates, and the other relaxed-clock model
parameters). More recent work,
*e.g.*, {% citet Heath2014 %}, uses macroevolutionary
models (the fossilized birth-death process) to calibrate phylogenies and
thus to infer dated trees.

In these tutorials we focus on the different types of macroevolutionary
models to study diversification processes and thus the
diversification-rate parameters themselves. Nevertheless, these
macroevolutionary models should be used for other evolutionary
questions, when an appropriate prior distribution on the tree and
divergence times is needed.


{% subsection Types of Hypotheses for Estimating Diversification Rates %}

Many evolutionary phenomena entail differential rates of diversification
(speciation – extinction); e.g., adaptive
radiation, diversity-dependent diversification, key innovations, and
mass extinction. The specific study questions regarding lineage
diversification may be classified within three fundamental categories of
inference problems. Admittedly, this classification scheme is somewhat
arbitrary, but it is nevertheless useful, as it allows users to navigate
the ever-increasing number of available phylogenetic methods. Below, we
describe each of the fundamental questions regarding diversification
rates.

{% subsubsection (1) Diversification-rate through time estimation %}

*What is the global rate of diversification in my study group?* The
most basic models estimate parameters of the stochastic-branching
process (*i.e.*, rates of speciation and
extinction, or composite parameters such as net-diversification and
relative-extinction rates) under the assumption that rates have remained
constant across lineages and through time;
*i.e.*,  under a constant-rate birth-death
stochastic-branching process model {% cite Nee1994b %}. Extensions to the
(basic) constant-rate models include diversification-rate variation
through time {% cite Stadler2011 Hoehna2015a %}. First, we might ask whether
there is evidence of an episodic, tree-wide increase in diversification
rates (associated with a sudden increase in speciation rate and/or
decrease in extinction rate), as might occur during an episode of
adaptive radiation. A second question asks whether there is evidence of
a continuous/gradual decrease in diversification rates through time
(associated with decreasing speciation rates and/or increasing
extinction rates), as might occur because of diversity-dependent
diversification (*i.e.*,  where competitive
ecological interactions among the species of a growing tree decrease the
opportunities for speciation and/or increase the probability of
extinction, e.g., {% citet Hoehna2014a %}). 
A final question in this category asks whether our
study tree was impacted by a mass-extinction event (where a large
fraction of the standing species diversity is suddenly lost,
e.g., {% citet May2016 %}). The common theme of these
studies is that the diversification process is tree-wide, that is, all
lineages of the study group have the exact same rates at a given time.


{% subsubsection (2) Diversification-rate through time estimation %}

*Are diversification rates correlated with some abiotic (e.g., environmental) variable in my study
group?*
If we have found evidence in the previous section that diversification rates vary
through time, then we can start asking the question whether these changes in diversification
rates are driven by some abiotic factors. 
For example, we can ask whether changes in diversification rates are correlated with
environmental factors, such as environmental CO<sub>2</sub> or temperature
{% cite Condamine2013 %}. 


{% subsubsection (3) Diversification-rate variation across branches estimation %}

*Is there evidence that diversification rates have varied significantly
across the branches of my study group?* Models have been developed to
detect departures from rate constancy across lineages; these tests are
analogous to methods that test for departures from a molecular
clock—*i.e.*,  to assess whether substitution
rates vary significantly across lineages {% cite Alfaro2009 Rabosky2014a %}.
These models are important for assessing whether a given tree violates
the assumptions of rate homogeneity among lineages. Furthermore, these
models are important to answer questions such as: *What are the
branch-specific diversification rates?*; and *Have there been
significant diversification-rate shifts along branches in my study
group, and if so, how many shifts, what magnitude of rate-shifts and
along which branches?*

{% subsubsection (4) Character-dependent diversification-rate estimation %}

*Are diversification rates correlated with some biotic (e.g., morphological) variable in my study
group?* Character-dependent diversification-rate models aim to identify
overall correlations between diversification rates and organismal
features (binary and multi-state discrete morphological traits,
continuous morphological traits, geographic range, etc.). For example,
one can hypothesize that a binary character, say if an organism is
herbivorous/carnivorous or self-compatible/self-incompatible, impact the
diversification rates. Then, if the organism is in state 0
(e.g., is herbivorous) it has a lower (or
higher) diversification rate than if the organism is in state 1
(e.g., carnivorous) {% cite Maddison2007 %}.
