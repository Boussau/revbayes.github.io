title: Bayesian phylogenetics and macroevolution in RevBayes
location: The Australian National University, Canberra, Australia
startdate: 2019-03-26

description: 
- This workshop will introduce participants to the theory and practice of phylogenetic inference methods for macroevolution using RevBayes. The three-day course is sponsored by the Centre for Biodivesity Analysis at the Australian National University. 

- The preliminary program for the three-day will entail&#58; (Day 1) An introduction to RevBayes and MCMC, (Day 2) Advanced applications in macroevolution, (Day 3) Emerging theory and methods around modeling molecular evolution and rate heterogeneity. Additional or alternative topics will be tailored to the interests of the participants (please see the <a href="https://revbayes.github.io/tutorials/">Tutorials</a> page for a list of possible topics). To indicate your intention to attend the course, please see the links in the workshop website provided below.

- It is recommended that you review the Pre-workshop Materials listed below if you do not already have a strong understanding of likelihood-based phylogenetics, probability, and Bayesian inference. These video lectures are buy <a href="https://phylogeny.uconn.edu/">Paul Lewis</a> and provide a clear overview of these topics. Additionally, a list of papers describing RevBayes and graphical models is given as suggested background reading.
